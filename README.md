## Calendar NTNU
Calendar NTNU is the comprehensive calendar for NTNU students. It's built on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), using [FullCalendar](http://fullcalendar.io/) with Google Calendar as backend events storage. Currently, events are managed by @WilliamSnail, @wi1d5ky, and @RexYuan.

## Google Calendar
* University events from the [official calendar](http://www.ntnu.edu.tw/aa/calendar.html) published by NTNU Office of Academic Affairs are in [Calendar_NTNU_School_Affairs](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=5u1e328q7aemec13aojvh5k2i4%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia/Taipei).
* Club and student-run organization events are in [Calendar_NTNU_Student_Events](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=k13fpdmsl2pmclrigapkt1iagk%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia/Taipei).
* Other things are temporarily stored in [Calendar_NTNU_Other](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=kbe3bdcmid49crp2cleb44ir1g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Asia/Taipei)
